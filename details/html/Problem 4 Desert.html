    <p style="font-size: x-large;"> 
        Deserts cover about one fifth of the Earth's surface and occur where rainfall is less than 50 cm/year. Although most deserts, such as the Sahara of North Africa and the deserts of the southwestern U.S., Mexico, and Australia, occur at low latitudes, another kind of desert, cold deserts, occur in the basin and range area of Utah and Nevada and in parts of western Asia.
         Most deserts have a considerable amount of specialized vegetation, as well as specialized vertebrate and invertebrate animals.Soils often have abundant nutrients because they need only water to become very productive and have little or no organic matter.
         Disturbances are common in the form of occasional fires or cold weather, and sudden, infrequent, but intense rains that cause flooding.<br><br>
         There are relatively few large mammals in deserts because most are not capable of storing sufficient water and withstanding the heat. Deserts often provide little shelter from the sun for large animals.The dominant animals of warm deserts are nonmammalian vertebrates, such as reptiles. Mammals are usually small, like the kangaroo mice of North American deserts.

    <strong style="font-size: xx-large;">Interesting Facts About the Sahara Desert</strong>
    <p style="font-size: x-large;">
        The Sahara is the hottest desert in the world – with one of the harshest climates. The average annual temperature is 30°C, whilst the hottest temperature ever recorded was 58°C. The area receives little rainfall, in fact, half of the Sahara Desert receives less than 1 inch of rain every year.<br>
    Despite many thinking of the Sahara as a constantly hot climate, temperatures drop dramatically at night, due to the lack of humidity, and can reach lows of -6°C. Snow falls regularly on several mountain ranges, but nowhere else in the Sahara.
